NAME
    Math::BigInt::GMP - backend library for Math::BigInt etc. based on GMP

SYNOPSIS
        # to use it with Math::BigInt
        use Math::BigInt lib => 'GMP';

        # to use it with Math::BigFloat
        use Math::BigFloat lib => 'GMP';

        # to use it with Math::BigRat
        use Math::BigRat lib => 'GMP';

DESCRIPTION
    Math::BigInt::GMP is a backend library for Math::BigInt, Math::BigFloat,
    Math::BigRat and related modules.

    Math::BigInt::GMP provides support for big integer calculations by means
    of the GMP C library. See <https://gmplib.org/> for more information
    about the GMP library.

    Math::BigInt::GMP no longer uses Math::GMP, but provides its own XS
    layer to access the GMP C library. This cuts out another (Perl
    subroutine) layer and also reduces the memory footprint.

    Math::BigInt::GMP inherits from Math::BigInt::Lib.

STATIC FUNCTIONS
  $str = gmp_version();
    Returns the underlying GMP library's version as a string, e.g., 6.2.1.

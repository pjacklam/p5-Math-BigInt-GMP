# NAME

Math::BigInt::GMP - backend library for Math::BigInt etc. based on GMP

# SYNOPSIS

    # to use it with Math::BigInt
    use Math::BigInt lib => 'GMP';

    # to use it with Math::BigFloat
    use Math::BigFloat lib => 'GMP';

    # to use it with Math::BigRat
    use Math::BigRat lib => 'GMP';

# DESCRIPTION

Math::BigInt::GMP is a backend library for Math::BigInt, Math::BigFloat,
Math::BigRat and related modules.

Math::BigInt::GMP provides support for big integer calculations by means of the
GMP C library. See [https://gmplib.org/](https://gmplib.org/) for more information about the GMP
library.

Math::BigInt::GMP no longer uses Math::GMP, but provides its own XS layer to
access the GMP C library. This cuts out another (Perl subroutine) layer and
also reduces the memory footprint.

Math::BigInt::GMP inherits from Math::BigInt::Lib.

# STATIC FUNCTIONS

## $str = gmp\_version();

Returns the underlying GMP library's version as a string, e.g., `6.2.1`.
